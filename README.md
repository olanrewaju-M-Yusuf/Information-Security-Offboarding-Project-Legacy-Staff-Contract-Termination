# Information Security Offboarding Project – Legacy Staff Contract Termination

## Project Title
**Enhancing Information Security Responsibility During Legacy Staff Offboarding and Contract Termination Procedures**

---

## 1. Background & Problem Statement
A mid-sized enterprise discovered that legacy employees—some of whom had admin or privileged access—were offboarded without formalized information security handover, de-provisioning, or asset retrieval. These gaps violated internal policy, posed insider threat risks, and created audit nonconformities. The GRC Analyst was tasked with creating and implementing a secure, auditable process for managing **information security responsibilities during legacy staff contract terminations.**

---

## 2. Objective
- Design a standardized offboarding security checklist for legacy staff
- Integrate HR, IT, and legal workflows into the offboarding process
- Ensure complete removal of logical and physical access to company systems
- Recover or verify return of all information assets
- Align process with ISO 27001:2022 Annex A.7 and NIST 800-53 IA-4, PS-4 controls

## 3. Stakeholders and Responsibilities
| Stakeholder              | Responsibility                                                                 |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HR Manager               | Triggers offboarding process, ensures contract closure and exit documentation   |
| GRC Analyst              | Creates the offboarding control list, monitors policy compliance                |
| IT Security Lead         | Revokes access rights, resets credentials, and validates logs                   |
| Legal Counsel            | Ensures confidentiality and post-termination clauses are enforced               |
| Department Managers      | Confirm return of devices and knowledge transfer completion                    |

## 4. Frameworks Used
- **ISO/IEC 27001:2022 Annex A.7.4.1 – Termination Responsibilities**: Ensures users exit cleanly and securely [(ISO, 2022)](https://www.iso.org/standard/82875.html)
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 – IA-4, PS-4**: Identity management and personnel termination protocols [(NIST, 2020)](https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-53/rev-5/final)

## 5. Project Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Gap Assessment & Risk Review
Conducted a gap analysis on offboarding practices for staff terminated in the past 3 years. Found missing audit trails for access removal and asset retrieval. Identified high-risk legacy admin accounts still active in cloud platforms.

### Step 2: Policy and Checklist Development
Created an offboarding policy with defined roles and timelines. Developed a 21-point termination checklist including VPN revocation, email account deactivation, device return, NDA acknowledgment, and knowledge transfer confirmation.

### Step 3: Workflow Integration with HR & IT
Embedded the checklist into the HRIS and Jira Service Desk. Triggers now auto-create offboarding tasks assigned to IT Security, Legal, and Managers. SLAs were established (e.g., access revocation within 4 hours of HR notice).

### Step 4: Audit Logging and Documentation
Established logging of offboarding events in Splunk and ServiceNow GRC. Reports generated monthly for internal audit review. Noncompliance alerts created for delayed or skipped steps.

### Step 5: Awareness & Governance
Delivered training sessions to HR, IT, and managers on their responsibilities. Created governance board to review terminations monthly and recommend process improvements.

## 6. Key Takeaways
- Legacy offboarding failures pose long-term data protection and compliance risks
- Integrating HR, IT, and GRC in offboarding reduces manual errors
- Automating checklist workflows ensures consistency and auditability
- Regular audits of privileged access post-termination are critical
- Legal alignment strengthens enforceability of post-employment obligations

---

## 7. Outcomes
- Created and enforced offboarding policy and checklist across all departments
- Removed 97% of orphaned accounts from historical terminations
- Reduced average access revocation time from 72 hours to 3.8 hours
- Improved termination audit compliance rate from 60% → 98%
- Enabled monthly audit logs reviewed by the GRC committee
